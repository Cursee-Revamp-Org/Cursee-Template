# Cursee Template

Cursee Template contains build scripts and other project files to create mods for Minecraft that  share
common code and are valid for different mod loaders such as Fabric, Forge, and NeoForge. Branches for
different Minecraft versions may target separate mod loaders, such as `1.20.1` containing modules for
Fabric and Forge, while `1.21.1` contains modules for Fabric, Forge, and NeoForge.

This project is the starting point for new mods developed by
[Cursee Development](https://github.com/Cursee-Development), and is derived from
[MultiLoader-Template](https://github.com/jaredlll08/MultiLoader-Template).

- [**Forgix** (GitHub)](https://github.com/PacifistMC/Forgix), by PacifistMC

Additional thanks goes to all others developing and contributing to open-source mods; you guys rule!
